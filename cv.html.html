								<p>
									If an employer has been lured in by your profile and been seduced by your key skills, the next thing they will look for on your CV is work experience.<br/><br/>

									But it can be tough figuring out which jobs to include, and which to not. Do they want to hear about your part-time job stacking shelves at Tesco? Or the three-days work shadowing at a local paper?<br/><br/>

									The answer is YES - if you show how you contributed to the business and what you learnt from your time there. You can do this by listing your key responsibilities and achievements for each role.<br/><br/>

									If you worked on the cheese counter at Waitrose for a summer, focus on the responsibilities you were given. Were you involved in pricing, or trusted with cashing up at the end of a shift? Were you allowed to reorganise the cheese? Did you hit your sales target?<br/><br/>

									Of course, if you have any work experience that is directly related to the placement, you will be catnip to employers. <br/>
